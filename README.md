# [emoojees](https://emoojees.com/)

> A cheat sheet for the emojis supported by GitHub in an easy to use website with
search, inspired by the markdown reference
[emoji-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md). Emojis
are compiled using the GitHub API and scraping the list of emojis on
[unicode.org](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html).
